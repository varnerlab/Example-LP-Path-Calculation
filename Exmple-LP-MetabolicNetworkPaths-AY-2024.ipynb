    "# Example: Using Linear Programming to Find Shortest Paths Through a Metabolic Network\n",
    "In this example, we'll use Linear Programming to compute the shortest paths in a metabolic network. This network connects a `source` compound, the starting point of our metabolic pathway, and a `target` compound, the endpoint. Computing these paths is crucial in metabolic engineering and related fields. To illustrate this, we'll use a simple metabolic network adapted from a [paper published by Palsson and coworkers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349503748991?via%3Dihub).\n",
